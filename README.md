# Solid Principles
### Encourage modularity, extensibility, scalability, maintainability, testability and everything ending with ity :p 

- Single Responsibility: Each module must have one sole purpose
- Open Closed: Each module should be open for extensions, closed for modifications
- Liskov Substitution: Each subclass must be substitutable by its superclass without affecting preconditions, postconditions or invariants
- Interface Segregation: Implementation classes must not be obliged to implement unneeded methods, thus split big interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: High level & low level modules should depend both on abstractions (interfaces / abstract classes)

``` module could be a class! ```
