Classes that implement an interface should not be required to implement methods that are irrelevant to them.
The goal of the Interface Segregation Principle is to keep interfaces focused and cohesive, promoting modularity and reducing coupling between components.

Pros:
- Single Responsibility
- Flexibility and Extensibility
- Reduces unnecessary dependencies

Cons:
- Increased Complexity
- Interface Explosion => hard to maintain
- Potential Over-Abstraction (Breaking down too granularly)
