Classes should be:
- Open for extension
- Closed for modification

In other words:
Upon needing to add more functionality, more classes are to be added 
and not old classes are to be edited!
(Polymorphism on Steroids)

Pros: 
- Extensibility
- Code Reusability
- Scalability

Cons:
- Could be hard to understand in certain cases
- Could be hard to implement
- Additional layers may impact performance
- OverEngineering 

Simple examples:
- AreaCalculator class must work with any type of Shape no matter how many 
shapes I add later on 
- Addition of new Animal species must not change code that might depend on it 
extend original class animal and implement the needed classes
- Instead of defining extra attribute "discount" to a product, create
a DiscountedProduct extending Product and implement custom getPrice() depending on discount
