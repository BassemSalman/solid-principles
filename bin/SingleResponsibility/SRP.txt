SRP is to let each class have solely one purpose, and not filled with excessive functionality

Pros:
- Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates behavior related to its responsibility
- Scalability
- Modularity
- Maintainability


Cons:
- Might be unecessary to split into lots of classes for a simple topic 

 If a class starts to have multiple responsibilities, it may be an indication that it should be split into smaller, more focused components, each with its own single responsibility.
